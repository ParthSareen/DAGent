## Notes
- [ ] Look if things run in memory and how to isolate for large workflows -> e.g. funcA(funcB(...)) -> funcA(...) -> funcB(...)
- [ ] Side effects/mutations
- [ ] Creating a data model for communication between functions + schema validation -> autogenerate? 
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Alerting on error
- [x] Add a compile method to derive data models and tool descriptions
- [ ] Docker
- [ ] simple chat memory
